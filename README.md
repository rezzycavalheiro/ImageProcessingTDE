# Image Processing

This is an app created to convert images from the camera or gallery to grayscale.
There are three ways of doing it:
- Setting the saturation to 0;
- Getting the average of all chanels (so each value divided by 3);
- Changing the values based on the weights of each channel (this one has the best result).
