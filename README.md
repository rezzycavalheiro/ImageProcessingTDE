# Image Processing

This is an app created to convert images from the camera or gallery to grayscale.
There are three ways of doing it:
- Setting the saturation to 0;
- Getting the average of all RGB chanels (so each value divided by 3);
- Changing the RGB values based on the weights of each channel (this one has the best result).

The video with the app running and explaining the code can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM-1Aqnbn7g&t=3s
